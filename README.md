# style-form
A form demo with style

This is the first time I actually style a Form

What I learned from this:

-Layering a page with a combination of flex and grid display
-Add validation with regex via the pattern property on the inputs
-Correctly use labels to make it easier to manipulate the form
-style buttons
-Use right  layers to position images one above other
-Use transparency to resalt text and images above others for the sake of clarity
-Use open source icons
